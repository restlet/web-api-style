The "Web API" style
===================

Formalization of the Web API architecture style, inspired from REST.

Based on this blog post and its comments:
http://blog.restlet.com/2013/05/02/how-much-rest-should-your-web-api-get/

Also based on the related discussion on REST-Discuss mailing list:
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/19371

As a guideline, we will rely on Roy T. Fielding's dissertation (not only chapter 5):

We will also rely on this book on software architecture from Richard N. Taylor (Roy's professor when REST waas formalized) and al.:
