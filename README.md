The "Web API" architecture style
================================

Formalization based on [this blog post and comments](http://blog.restlet.com/2013/05/02/how-much-rest-should-your-web-api-get/), especially based on the [following discussion on the REST-Discuss list](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/19371).

As a guideline, we will rely on [Roy T. Fielding's dissertation](http://roy.gbiv.com/pubs/dissertation/top.htm), not only chapter 5. 

We will also rely on [this book on software architecture](http://www.amazon.com/Software-Architecture-Foundations-Theory-Practice/dp/0470167742/) from Richard N. Taylor (Roy's professor when REST was formalized) and al.
