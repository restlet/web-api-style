The "Web API" architecture style
================================

Formalization based on this blog post and comments:
http://blog.restlet.com/2013/05/02/how-much-rest-should-your-web-api-get/

Especially based on the following discussion on the REST-Discuss list:
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/19371

As a guideline, we will rely on Roy T. Fielding's dissertation (not only chapter 5):
http://roy.gbiv.com/pubs/dissertation/top.htm

We will also rely on this book on software architecture from Richard N. Taylor (Roy's professor when REST waas formalized) and al.:
